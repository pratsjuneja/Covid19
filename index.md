## Face Mask Detection
Due to the recent pandemic, wearing a FaceMask has been made mandatory across the nation. There has been a certain amount of pushback to this policy, causing stores to actually use their staff to routinely stand at the door and remove people not wearing a mask. The goal of this project is to come up with a way to detect if a FaceMask is being worn by an individual correctly.
